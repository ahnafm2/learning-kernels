# Learning Kernels
This is the python replica (with some bug fixes) of the code from amansinha/learning-kernels which was coded in MATLAB.

The work was done as part of project for class Vector Space Signal Processing at University of Illinois. We analyzed works that involved learning kernels using randomized features: 

* "Weighted Sums of Randomized Kitchen Sinks" by Benjamin Recht and Ali Rahimi 
* "Learning Kernels with Random Features" by Aman Sinha and John Duchi 
* "Projection onto a Simplex" by Yunmei Chen and Xiaojing Ye

## Code
The code includes jupyter notebook file that has the demo from the second paper specified previously. Also it includes original code for testing on data sets from the scikit-learn library.
